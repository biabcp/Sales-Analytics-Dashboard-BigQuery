# Sales Analytics Dashboard using Google BigQuery

This project demonstrates the creation of a sales analytics dashboard using Google BigQuery to analyze sales data, retrieve insights using SQL queries, and visualize results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a sales analytics dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales data. The project utilizes Google BigQuery to store and analyze the sales data and Jupyter Notebook for generating visualizations based on the SQL query results.

## Project Structure

- `sample_sales_data.csv`: Sample sales data in CSV format.
- `sql_queries.sql`: SQL queries for retrieving insights from the sales data.
- `sales_visualizations.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with visualizations based on SQL query results.

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with BigQuery enabled.
- Sample sales dataset (`sample_sales_data.csv`) loaded into BigQuery.

## Setup

1. Load the sample sales data (`sample_sales_data.csv`) into BigQuery.
2. Run the SQL queries from `sql_queries.sql` in BigQuery to retrieve insights.
3. Open `sales_visualizations.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore visualizations.

## SQL Queries

The `sql_queries.sql` file contains a variety of SQL queries for retrieving insights from the sales data. These queries cover aspects such as revenue analysis, customer behavior, sales trends, and more. The queries are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the data and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Visualizations

The `sales_visualizations.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations based on the SQL query results. It uses Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative charts and graphs that help interpret the insights obtained from the data.
